In this checkpoint, students will demonstrate their ability to build full-stack applications independently. For the client, students will implement VueJs with Vue-Router. On the server-side, students will use Express with Node.js and MongoDB with Mongoose to manage their databases and handle both one-to-many and many-to-many data relationships.In addition, students will implement identity management with Auth0.
